### World Generation Pipeline (Completed)
1. **âœ… Geometric World Generation**
   - Icosahedral subdivision creating 163,842+ tiles
   - Proper spherical geometry with normalized vertices
   - Pentagon/hexagon tile structure (12 pentagons + hexagons)
   - Neighbor relationships for all tiles
   - Removed old noise-based terrain generation

2. **âœ… Tectonic Plate Generation**  
   - Fibonacci sphere distribution for realistic plate centers
   - Realistic movement patterns based on simulated mantle convection
   - Oceanic vs continental plate classification (30% oceanic)
   - 24 plates generated with proper tile assignments
   - **Base elevation assignment**: Oceanic plates ~0.15-0.25, Continental plates ~0.5-0.8
   - Natural terrain variation within each plate using trigonometric noise

3. **âœ… Advanced Mountain Generation**
   - **Distance-based influence**: All tiles affected by plate boundaries
   - **66+ plate boundaries analyzed** with stress calculations
   - **Geological boundary types**: Convergent, divergent, transform
   - **Increased elevation scaling**: Mountains now visible (2,835 mountain tiles)
   - **Folding patterns**: Parallel ridges and valleys
   - **Isostatic adjustment**: Crustal thickening effects
   - **Preserves existing elevation**: Adds to plate base elevation rather than replacing

4. **âœ… Biome Generation**
   - **Terrain type assignment**: Based purely on final elevation
   - **Biome assignment**: Based on elevation, temperature, and moisture
   - **Proper distribution**: Ocean, shallow, beach, lowland, highland, mountain terrain types
   - **Climate-aware biomes**: From tropical rainforest to polar desert

### Technical Achievements

## ðŸ”„ ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Functional vs Class-Based Approach
**Decision**: Migrated to functional programming  
**Rationale**: 
- Easier testing and debugging
- Better composability
- Clearer data flow
- Simpler to extend with new generators

### 2. Pipeline Orchestration
**Decision**: Single Generator.cpp coordinates all phases  
**Rationale**:
- Central progress tracking
- Clean dependency management  
- Easy to add new phases
- Maintains separation of concerns

### 3. Distance-Based Mountain Generation
**Decision**: Affect all tiles based on distance from boundaries  
**Rationale**:
- More realistic than boundary-only approach
- Creates proper mountain ranges extending inland
- Allows for realistic elevation gradients
- Supports complex geological formations

### 4. Separation of Terrain and Biome Assignment
**Decision**: Biome generator handles terrain types and biomes  
**Rationale**:
- Terrain type is environmental, not plate-based
- Allows for consistent elevation-based classification
- Enables future climate system integration
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 5. Legacy Code Preservation  
**Decision**: Comment out (don't delete) old implementations  
**Rationale**:
- Preserves reference material
- Allows easy comparison during development
- Documents evolution of the codebase
- Maintains institutional knowledge
